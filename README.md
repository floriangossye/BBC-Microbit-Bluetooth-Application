# microbit-led-bluetooth-app

Introduction

I'm writing an application which connects your smartphone with the BBC Microbit. The application consists of prototypes to interact
with the microbit. I'm writing this with the evothings studio because this platform supports the use of the microbit easily. 

Currently working on creating google maps work within the app, with the javascript google maps api.
